##**Data Transfer Between Devices Using Ultrasound**##

In this project a text message is transmitted through speakers using ultrasound frequencies and it is received via a microphone. To send a message you should run transmit.py first and to receive it run receive.py.

####*MODULES*####

Below you can see the necessary modules and their versions that were used in generating and testing this code:

- PyAudio==0.2.9
- numpy==1.11.1

####*USAGE*####

These scripts are generated using Python 2.7 and they are tested on OS X El Capitan. You can install necessary packages from terminal using the given command below:

`pip install packagename`

To run the scripts you can use a Python IDE or again using the terminal you can run them like this:

`python scriptname.py`

If you are going to use a microphone and speakers in the same device please open two separate terminals or IDE windows to run two different scripts. Once you run them enter a message to be transmitted and observe the other window where the message will be received.
